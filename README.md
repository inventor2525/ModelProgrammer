# Bad Idea
An experiment in letting AI use the terminal with human supervision to accomplish more complex tasks.

# Why?
1. Current LLMs can already code larger projects, they just need to not require so much back and forth copy paste. My time as a programmer has been relogated significantly to clipboard transfer, this is not ideal. It needs to be more "ideate review confirm modify".
1. To experiment with LLM debugging capabilities.
1. (future) experiment with bootstrapping through terminal usage. In theory, LLMs (even smaller ones!) should learn to code MUCH better if they had to debug their own code or write patches rather than spit out snippets.
